# BackspaceMeansBackspace

Prevents the Backspace key from triggering Chrome's Back action.

## This Distribution

This is a Github repo of the extension found at [chromeextensions.org/appearance-functioning/backspacemeansbackspace](http://www.chromeextensions.org/appearance-functioning/backspacemeansbackspace/)

All the links on that page and in the extension point to [nollegcraft.com/code/GoogleChromeExtension/BackspaceMeansBackspace](http://www.nollegcraft.com/code/GoogleChromeExtension/BackspaceMeansBackspace/), but that domain doesn't appear to be serving a sensible site any longer.

I'll be updating this to work with modern versions of Chrome, and I'll consider putting it in the Chrome store.
